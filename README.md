The light blinking will guide people to touch different. After touching the pushsensor above the shape, the speaker will relaese different tone. Then next light blink to guide people to go next. people can play a song just follow the light.

# week 4

Essential elements
Arduino
Breadboard
LED (bulb)
push sensors
Speaker buzzer
Battery

Steps:
1) Get the LED to blink one by one 
2) Get the speaker buzzer plays different tone by toch the push sensor
2) Put everything together
8) Attach battery and a switch

picture of the first iteration
video of your working project (upload to YouTube and post a link)
code (or a written description of what the code should do, if it's not yet working)
schematic showing the relevant connections from Arduino to sensors and output devices: hand-drawn or Fritzing
Write a concept proposal for your final project
Your final project can be a fuly developed iteration of your midterm project incorporating "nice to have" functionality from the initial concept or additional functionality suggested by the first iteration.
OR
a new project, substantially more complex than the exercises you've done so far.
